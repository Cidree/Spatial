## Minimum standards

We encourage the packages authors to follow minimum standards for their package to be included in the Spatial CRAN Task View:

- The package must be related to spatial data reading/writing, handling, processing, or analyzing
- The package should be actively maintained
- The package should have extended documentation in the form of a vignette, blog post, scientific article, technical report, or video. In other words, there should be a way for new users to get started with using the package

Packages already listed, but without extended documentation are encouraged to add more documentation in a forthcoming revision of the package.
